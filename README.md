# hand-tracking-and-gesture-recognition
Hand Tracking Module:
It utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and landmark detection.
MediaPipe employs a machine learning-based approach to perform hand tracking and landmark estimation.
The specific training model used by MediaPipe for hand tracking is known as the BlazePalm model.
Volume Control by gesture:
It uses computer vision techniques to track hand gestures captured by a webcam and control the volume based on those gestures.
The main working of the code can be explained as follows:
1 Video Capture Hand Tracking
 The code uses the OpenCV library (cv2) to capture video frames.
An instance of the HandDetector class from the HandTrackingModule is created.
This custom module likely contains hand tracking and gesture recognition algorithms.
2: Audio Endpoint Volume Control:
 The code uses the pycaw library to interact with the Windows Core Audio API (COM API) for controlling audio settings.
